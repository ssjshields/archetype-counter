Archetype Counter is a PowerShell WinForm script for the online video game [PokeMMO](https://pokemmo.com/).

Automatically tracks encounters (Horde, Safari, etc.) and when you receive Eggs or Fossils.
 
Does not hook into the PokeMMO or javaw process. Utilizes [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and [OCR](https://www.ibm.com/blog/optical-character-recognition/) technology.

Useful for [shiny hunting](https://Pok√©mondb.net/pokedex/shiny) or metrics lovers. Feel like exploring? Give our [client theme](https://github.com/ssjshields/archetype#readme) a try.

**Requires Windows 10+**

&nbsp;
# Expectations
> Counter must be in counting mode (ON) before receiving Eggs / Fossils or when encounters begin

> Tracking occurs via battle monster nameplates, [OCR](https://www.ibm.com/blog/optical-character-recognition/) will not process properly if there is anything blocking them

> String ids which contain text such as "{user} recieved Eggs / Fossils" cannot be removed from the game entirely

&nbsp;
# Installation
**1.** Extract into `PokeMMO\data\mods`

> Alternatively, clone into `PokeMMO\data\mods` using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), pull to receive updates

**2.** Run the `Archetype Counter.lnk`, pin to the taskbar if needed (After you run at least once)

> Ensure you run the `Archetype Counter.lnk` shortcut once before pinning to taskbar or any other location

> Do not pin the Counter from the taskbar while it's running, otherwise it will pin the Powershell terminal instead

&nbsp;
# Removal
**1.** From the Counter menu navigate to Settings ‚Üí Uninstall Archetype Counter

> All Counter files and theme modifications are removed automatically

# FAQ
### How does the Counter work?
> [OCR](https://www.ibm.com/blog/optical-character-recognition/) and several other utilities are used to scan screenshots of monster names and compares them against a list

> Monster nameplates processed using images passed through [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) formula by realmadrid1809 + additional logic cleanup in PowerShell

> Utilities scripted with PowerShell 5.1 by AnonymousPoke

### Does the counter work on Linux, MacOS or mobile?
> Unfortunately no - the Counter utilizes built in Windows OCR (OCR, Powershell, etc.) + Tesseract OCR & ImageMagick

### Does this work with custom PokeMMO client themes?
> Yes, it will work with all custom themes, but the monster nameplate text will be modified to be OCR compatible

> Client theme.xml, font values and graphical assets (AC folder) are inserted into the currently installed theme list

### How do I make custom Counter theme?
> Open the counter menu and navigate to -> Theme Selector -> "Open Theme Folder" and modify the .png images accordingly

> Modifying the `ThemeConfig.txt` file will allow you to change the font/background colors along with font sizing & types

### Does the Counter track Shiny Pok√©mon?
> Yes it does and it will also provide a prompt provided by the counter indicating a shiny is on the screen (Extra layer to prevent defeating or running from the shiny)

### Does the Counter track Alpha Pok√©mon?
> Yes, but only as a total count in the counter - will not add to the normal tracked monster count

### Does the Counter track Legendary Pok√©mon?
> Yes, but currently only the 3 legendary dogs from Johto (Raikou, Suicune, and Entei)

### How are Eggs and Fossils tracked?
> When the user retrieves them - by tracking the word `egg` & `recieved` for eggs / by tracking the word `<FossilMonsterName>` & `recieved` for fossils

> Events / trades do not log towards count

> If you are using custom strings do not completely remove receieved Egg / Fossil dialog

### Does the counter track Zorua or Zoroark?
> Due to this Pok√©mon and it's ability.. No.

### Can the Counter track 2 different Pok√©mon in a double wild battle or horde?
> Currently the counter does not support these types of battles and you may get mixes results when tracked in the counter

### Can I convert data from other counters?
> Yes, right-click empty slot to manually set monster via dex number, middle-click (scroll wheel) to manually set count

> Manually editing profiles may cause corruption - located in `Files\Counter Config Files`

### When I go into battle, the counter does not count or go busy. What do I do?
> Go into the counter menu and change your Picture Mode from `PrintWindow (Default)` to `PrintScreen (Alternate)` - If this does not resolve issue, please report a bug

### How do I fix incorrect scanned Pok√©mon names with the 'Name Fix' file?
> When a monster is incorrectly scanned via OCR, you take the 'failed' name and place it on the left hand side of the semi-colon and then take the correct monster name and place to the right of the semi-colon

> `(Ex: Gastiy; Gastly)`

> You will need to turn the counter OFF and then back ON for these changes to take effect

### How do I manually remove additional characters/symbols from the failed scan?
> Open up the 'Name Fix' file from the counter menu and take the partial/incorrect text and place on the left hand side of the semi-colon and then place the word 'Blank' on the right hand side of the semi-colon

> `(Ex: GastE; Blank)`

> When a 'Blank' is provided on the right hand side of the semi-colon, this indicates the counter to completely remove that specific text - You will need to turn the counter OFF and then back ON for these changes to take effect

### Does the Counter support transparency when making custom themes?
> No - this is a limitation with the PowerShell WinForms GUI

### How do I move the counter location to the top of the screen edge?
> Move the counter as closely as possible to the top of the screen and then utilize the arrows keys to move to desired location

### Can I manually add a count to the tracked Pok√©mon and total count in the Counter?
> See `Main Navigation` above

### Can I preset a Pok√©mon in the counter before being tracked?
> See `Main Navigation` above

### How can I report a bug?
> You cannot. ThislLegacy version is no longer supported.
